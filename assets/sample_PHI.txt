John Doe, a 47-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presented with a week-long struggle of throbbing headaches on the right side of his head, worsening with activity, and accompanied by dizziness upon standing. His blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg raised concerns, even though he takes Lisinopril daily for control. To determine the cause of his headaches, further evaluation with brain imaging and continued blood pressure management are recommended, along with over-the-counter pain relief for symptom control. A follow-up appointment is scheduled to discuss test results and potentially adjust the treatment plan.
